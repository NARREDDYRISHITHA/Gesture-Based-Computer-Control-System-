# 🖐️🎤 Gesture and Voice-Controlled Application

This Python-based project combines computer vision and voice recognition to allow users to control various system functions using **hand gestures** and **voice commands**. It uses **MediaPipe** for hand tracking, **SpeechRecognition** for capturing voice commands, and **PyAutoGUI** for simulating keyboard and mouse actions.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Voice command activation** for:
  - Stopping applications
  - Controlling volume
  - Switching tabs
  - Scrolling content

- **Hand gesture detection**:
  - Fist to close apps
  - Finger pinch to switch tabs
  - Thumb–index distance to control volume
  - Swipe up/down gesture for scrolling

## ▶️ How to Run

Run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

* Allow microphone and camera access when prompted.
* Speak one of the following commands:

  * `"stop application"` — then make a fist gesture to close the active window.
  * `"control volume"` — pinch and move fingers to increase or decrease volume.
  * `"switch tab"` — pinch gesture to switch between open tabs.
  * `"scroll"` — swipe up/down with your index finger to scroll.

Press `q` to quit the application.

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

* **Mic or Camera not working?**

  * Ensure permissions are granted.
  * Check device drivers or try a different device.
* **Command not recognized?**

  * Speak clearly in a quiet environment.
  * Ensure stable internet for speech recognition.
